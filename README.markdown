MK is a set of common plumbing that different [WSAPI](http://keplerproject.github.com/wsapi) applications
and frameworks can use to do things like share a single authentication system, easily create inter-application
links, and embed pieces of content created by different frameworks (mixing Orbit and Sputnik content in the same
page, for example).

Look in the `samples` and `tests` folders to see examples of the APIs as they are right now.
